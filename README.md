This is a presentation using various data visualization and statistical techniques to analyze an educational role-playing video game in which players can experience simulated life scenarios and learn to make good decisions that will benefit their well being and prevent risk when similar situations occur in real life. The goal was to analyze the data collected from previous trials of the game, including click rate, time spent, and completion rate. In particular, we analyzed what specific factors drove total time spent playing the game, one of the biggest areas of the legal service in need of improvement. The [**presentation**](https://github.com/tdewing19/video-game-analysis/blob/main/DataFest_2022_Submission.pdf) contains our findings with corresponding data visualizations.
